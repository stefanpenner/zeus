# Zeus

## What?

Zeus preloads your app so that your normal development tasks such as `console`, `server`, `generate`, and tests are faster.

[Mediocre screencast](http://burke.libbey.me/zeus.mov). Better one coming soon.

## Why?

Because waiting 25 seconds sucks, but waiting 0.4 seconds doesn't.

## When?

Soon? You can use Zeus now, but don't expect it to be perfect. I'm working hard on it.

## Ugly bits

* Not battle-tested yet
* Creates a bunch of sockets
* Uses an obscene number of file descriptors

## Installation

Install the gem.

    gem install zeus

Copy `examples/rails.rb` to `{your app}/.zeus.rb`

## Usage

Start the server:

    zeus start

Run some commands:

    zeus console
    zeus server
    zeus testrb -Itest -I. test/unit/omg_test.rb
    zeus generate model omg
    zeus rake -T
    zeus runner omg.rb

## TODO (roughly prioritized)

* Make the code less terrible
* Figure out how to run full test suites without multiple env loads
* Support other frameworks?
* Use fsevent instead of kqueue to reduce the obscene number of file descriptors.
* Support inotify on linux
* Once it's really stable, transparently start the process in the background rather than requiring zeus start.
* Handle connections for not-yet-started sockets
* Don't replace a socket with changed deps until the new one is ready
